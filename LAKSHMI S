TASK 1 : *API
Weather Application using OpenWeather API
Objective:
The main aim of this task is to learn how an API works and to use it in a simple project. For this, I created a small Weather Application. The app asks the user for a city name and then shows the weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description of the weather (example: sunny, cloudy, rainy).

What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a messenger between two programs. It helps one program to get data or services from another program.

For example:
A weather app uses a weather service API to get the latest temperature.
A map app uses Google Maps API to show directions.
In this task , I used the OpenWeather API, which provides live weather data.

About OpenWeather API
It is a free service that gives current weather information.
We can get details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
It provides data in JSON format, which is easy to read and use in a program.
Website: https://openweathermap.org/api

Implementation
Tools Used
HTML → for designing the webpage
CSS → for styling (basic)
JavaScript → for calling the API and showing results
OpenWeather API → for getting live weather data

Steps Followed
*First, I signed up on the OpenWeather website and got an API key.
*I made a simple webpage with an input box for entering the city name.
*I wrote JavaScript code to call the OpenWeather API using the fetch() method.
The API sent back data in JSON format, and I displayed the useful parts like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Finally, I tested the app by entering different city names.
